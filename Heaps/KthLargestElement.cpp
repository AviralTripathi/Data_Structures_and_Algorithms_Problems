Follow the steps to implement the above approach:

Create an empty max heap of integers using the C++ STL priority_queue container.
Traverse the binary search tree in reverse in-order sequence using a stack.
At each node, add the node value to the max heap.
If the size of the max heap becomes greater than K, remove the maximum element from the max heap.
After we finish traversing the binary search tree, the maximum element in the max heap will be the Kth largest element in the binary search tree.


  int kthLargest(Node* root, int K)
{
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
    // Traverse the binary search tree and add elements to
    // the max heap
    stack<Node*> s;
    Node* curr = root;
    while (curr != NULL || s.empty() == false) {
        while (curr != NULL) {
            s.push(curr);
            curr = curr->right;
        }
        curr = s.top();
        s.pop();
        maxHeap.push(curr->data);
        curr = curr->left;
    }
    // Remove K-1 elements from the max heap
    for (int i = 1; i < K; i++) {
        maxHeap.pop();
    }
    // The top element of the max heap is the Kth largest
    // element
    return maxHeap.top();
}

Time Complexity: O(n logk) , The worst-case time complexity of building a max heap of size k is O(klogk).
The worst-case time complexity of traversing a binary search tree in reverse in-order sequence is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

Space Complexity: O(k), We use a max heap of size k to keep track of the k largest elements in the binary search tree.
Therefore, the overall space complexity of this approach is O(k).
