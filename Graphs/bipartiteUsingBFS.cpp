The given code checks if a graph is bipartite using a BFS approach. A graph is bipartite if it can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

Key Components:
Helper Function: bfs

This function performs a BFS traversal to try and color the graph starting from a given node (sv).
Parameters:
graph: Adjacency list representation of the graph.
color: Vector to store the color of each node. Initialized to -1, indicating uncolored.
sv: Starting vertex for the BFS traversal.
Main Function: isBipartite

This function iterates over all nodes to ensure every component of the graph is checked (to handle disconnected graphs).
Detailed Breakdown:
bfs Function:
Initialization:
A queue q is initialized and the starting vertex sv is colored with 0.
BFS Traversal:
The BFS loop continues until the queue is empty.
For each node t dequeued, its neighbors are checked.
If a neighbor is uncolored (color[x] == -1), it is colored with the opposite color (!c) and enqueued.
If a neighbor has the same color (color[x] == c), it indicates a conflict, and the graph is not bipartite.
isBipartite Function:
Initialization:
color vector is initialized to -1 for all nodes, indicating they are uncolored.
Iterate Over All Nodes:
The loop ensures that every node (including disconnected components) is checked.
If a node is uncolored, bfs is called starting from that node.
If any component of the graph is found not to be bipartite (bfs returns false), the function returns false.
If all components are successfully colored bipartitely, the function returns true.
Example to Illustrate:
Consider the graph represented by the adjacency list:

cpp
Copy code
vector<vector<int>> graph = {
    {1, 3},
    {0, 2},
    {1, 3},
    {0, 2}
};
Initialization:

color vector: [-1, -1, -1, -1].
Starting BFS from Node 0:

Color node 0 with 0: color becomes [0, -1, -1, -1].
Process neighbors of 0: Node 1 is colored 1, Node 3 is colored 1.
color becomes [0, 1, -1, 1].
Process node 1: Node 2 is colored 0.
color becomes [0, 1, 0, 1].
Continue processing remaining nodes without conflict.
Check Remaining Nodes:

Node 1, 2, and 3 are already colored, no further action needed.
Result:

No conflicts found, the graph is bipartite.
Summary:
The code checks if a graph is bipartite using BFS.
It ensures all nodes (including those in disconnected components) are checked.
It uses a color array to track the coloring of nodes, ensuring no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
The BFS function returns false if a conflict (same color on adjacent nodes) is detected, indicating the graph is not bipartite.




Code:

  class Solution {
private:
    bool bfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph,vector<int>& color,int sv){
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(sv);
        color[sv]=0;
        while(!q.empty()){
            int t=q.front();
            int c=color[t];
            q.pop();
            for(auto x:graph[t]){
                if(color[x]==-1){
                    color[x]=!c;
                    q.push(x);
                }
                else if(color[x]==c){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

public:
    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n=graph.size();
        vector<int> color(n,-1);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(color[i]==-1){
                if(bfs(graph,color,i)==false){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
